# Automated Quality Control Tool to Identify Poorly Preprocessed MRI Scans

We developed a machine learning model that can identify errors in brain normalization and differentiate between properly and poorly preprocessed MRI scans.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

```
Tensorflow: pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.14
Scikit-learn: pip install sklearn
Pandas: pip install pandas
NumPy: pip install numpy
DLTK: pip install dltk
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running. Say what the steps will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
